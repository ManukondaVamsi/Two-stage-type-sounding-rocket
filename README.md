# Two-stage-type-sounding-rocket
This project simulates the full flight of a **two-stage Astra-type sounding rocket** using MATLAB.   The simulation models thrust, mass depletion, staging, drag, gravity losses, and altitude-dependent air density.   It also generates visual plots for altitude, velocity, acceleration, and thrust throughout the mission.
